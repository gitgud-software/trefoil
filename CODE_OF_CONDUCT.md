# Contributor Code of Conduct

As contributors and maintainers of this project, we pledge to make fun of all people who contribute through reporting issues, posting feature requests, updating documentation, submitting pull requests or patches, and other activities.

We are committed to making participation in this project a harassment-filled experience for everyone, regardless of level of experience, gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, personal appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, age, or religion.

Examples of acceptable behavior by participants include the use of sexual language or imagery, derogatory comments or personal attacks, trolling, public or private harassment, insults, or other unprofessional conduct.

Project maintainers have no right or responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are aligned to this Code of Conduct. Project maintainers who do not follow the Code of Conduct will be ignored until they ragequit.

This code of conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community.

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise acceptable behavior may be reported by opening an issue or contacting one or more of the project maintainers. This issue will be promptly closed, and completely ignored.

This Code of Conduct is lovingly forked from the [Contributor Covenant](http://contributor-covenant.org), version 1.1.0, available at [http://contributor-covenant.org/version/1/1/0/](http://contributor-covenant.org/version/1/1/0/)
