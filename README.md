## Issues

1. Special characters break list items. (UTF-8 support when?)
2. At least one particularly long post on /biz/ broke the post Card in a way I can't reproduce yet.
3. No image support. Sorry, but this is a text-only app.
4. Webpages only open in Pebble's Webview page normally used for settings. This app does not open Clover, Chanu, or your web browser of choice.
